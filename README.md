---> Password strength checker made with GUI (Tikinter): 
     This checks the strength of your password by showing you how many times the password has been compromised using
     a password api ('https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/'). 
   
---> Instructions:
     Type your password into the entry box and then press the 'check password' button.
     If you are looking to check another password right away just erase the previous
     password with a space bar and type the new password and press the 'check password' button
     to get your different result. if you need to check wether the password your typed was typed correctly
     you press the reveal button.
